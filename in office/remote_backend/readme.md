this remote_backend creation was generally a class exerise to write terraform file while referring to documentation as Sai told us not to run 
this "remote backend" file because running this will create a backend in terraform cloud dashboard and to access it we have to login in terraform cloud.
If we want to create a backend in AWS we have to do so using s3 and then backend can be seen in AWS console under S3.
